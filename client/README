# Assumptions
- file transfer is text files only
- transfer hello.txt saved in the server folder to the client folder 
- localhost of the machine should be set accordingly. eg 192.168.68.59
- client program runs once and exits


# Test procedure
- run server by typing gcc main.c server.c -o main followed by main from the command prompt in the server
- run client by typing gcc main.c client.c -o main followed by main from the command prompt in the client
- click enter from the client to download hello.txt from the server
- can run multiple clients at once
- server keeps waiting for connection and sends data until user presses ctrl+c to stop the server
